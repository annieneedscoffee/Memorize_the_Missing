# Memorize_the_Missing
This is a flashcard system written in javascript, jquery, css, materialize, and html to help people memorize the faces and names of missing people. It uses an object of fictional missing people that could easily be replaced with an API of real missing people. It also includes a points system to help drive people to complete the process. This points system could be used for raffle drawings, coupons, or whatever the organization using the software has available to give away.
